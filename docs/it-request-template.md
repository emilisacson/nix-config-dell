# IT Request: OneNote Graph API Access

## Request Summary
Request for Azure App Registration to enable OneNote data access via Microsoft Graph API for improved productivity and note management.

## Business Justification
- Need to access multiple OneNote notebooks efficiently
- Current web interface limitations impact productivity
- Requirement for better search capabilities across notebooks
- Need for offline access and backup of important documentation

## Technical Requirements

### App Registration Details
- **Application Name**: OneNote Sync Tool
- **Application Type**: Public client/native (mobile & desktop)
- **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost`
- **Required Permissions**:
  - Microsoft Graph API â†’ Delegated permissions:
    - `Notes.Read` - Read user's OneNote notebooks
    - `Notes.ReadWrite` - Read and write user's OneNote notebooks

### Security Considerations
- Application uses delegated permissions (user context only)
- No application-level permissions requested
- Standard OAuth2 flow with user consent
- Data processed locally on user's device
- No data transmitted to third parties

### Use Case
- Export OneNote content to local markdown files
- Enable better search and organization of notes
- Provide offline access to important documentation
- Integrate with development tools (VS Code) for technical documentation

### Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Web OneNote**: Limited multi-account support, poor search
2. **P3X OneNote**: Doesn't support corporate accounts reliably
3. **Wine/Windows emulation**: Unsuccessful on Linux

### Implementation
- Tool runs locally on user's workstation
- Uses Microsoft's official Graph API
- Follows Microsoft security best practices
- Code is open source and auditable
